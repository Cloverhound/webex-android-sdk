    Use a locally-built sqlcipher that addresses a bug. Fixes #5014
    
    SqlCipher issue: https://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher/issues/301
    SqlCipher commit: https://github.com/tsombrero/android-database-sqlcipher/commit/7f9d8a7e2746540e3da087a9e799f7170b4baa47
    
    To build the sqlcipher jars and shared libraries, fetch this fork and follow the android-database-sqlcipher build instructions:
    https://github.com/tsombrero/android-database-sqlcipher

Eventually, hopefully, that commit will get merged and we can go back to using a normal gradle include.
